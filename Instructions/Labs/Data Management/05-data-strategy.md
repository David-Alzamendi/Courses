# Fictitious Company
EverBright Retailers, a prominent retail company known for its wide range of sustainable and eco-friendly products, has experienced a drop in its Net Promoter Score (NPS) from 65 to 60 over the past year. This decline has triggered concerns within the senior management team about customer satisfaction, loyalty, and the overall brand perception in the market. EverBright prides itself on being a customer-centric organisation, and maintaining a high NPS is crucial for its business strategy and growth plans.

## Business Challenge
The decrease in NPS is a significant concern for EverBright Retailers as it directly impacts customer loyalty and the likelihood of positive word-of-mouth, which has historically been a key driver of EverBright’s growth. The company has set ambitious Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to not only recover the NPS to its previous level of 65 within the upcoming year but also to increase it further to 70 within two years. Achieving these targets is considered critical for sustaining and enhancing EverBright’s market position, especially in the highly competitive eco-friendly products sector.


## Diagnosis
Initial analysis suggests multiple factors contributing to the NPS decline, including customer perceptions of value for money, the in-store experience, and post-purchase support. Despite the high quality of products, feedback indicates that customers are seeking more engaging and personalised shopping experiences, both online and in physical stores. Additionally, there seems to be a gap in effective communication regarding the sustainability impact of customers’ purchases, which is a key motivator for EverBright's target market.


## Strategic Objectives
- Enhance Customer Experience: Improve the overall shopping experience through personalisation, streamlined purchasing processes, and superior in-store service.
- Strengthen Post-Purchase Support: Develop robust after-sales support to assist customers with their purchases, ensuring satisfaction and addressing any concerns promptly.
- Communicate Impact: Clearly articulate the positive environmental impact of customers’ purchases, reinforcing the value and aligning with the motivations of EverBright’s eco-conscious customer base.


# Instructions
Develop a Data Strategy that takes into account the business challenges and goals at EverBright.

In the Data Strategy, suggest a system, data entities and information that could help develop a guiding policy that aligns with EverBright’s goal of improving NPS. This policy should address identified challenges and capitalize on opportunities to enhance the customer experience through data-driven insights.

# Expected Outcome

By the end of the exercise, participants will have created a data strategy that not only outlines how to use data to achieve business objectives but also demonstrates a clear understanding of strategic thinking as outlined by Rumelt. The strategy will be grounded in a solid diagnosis of the current state, guided by a clear policy, and enacted through coherent, actionable steps.
